I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Traffic Information Engineering & Control from Wuhan University of Technology from 2016, where I am advised by Prof. Kezhong Liu in the Martime Intelligent Transportation System Group. I am also co-adviced by Prof. Cong Liu from The University of Texas at Dallas, where I spent .

My PhD work has been focusing on developing efficient real-time scheduling algorithms and timing validation techniques to enhance the computing capability of safety-critical embedded systems (often called cyber-physical systems â€“ CPS) powered by homogeneous or heterogeneous multicore platforms.
