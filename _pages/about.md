I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Traffic Information Engineering & Control from Wuhan University of Technology from 2016, where I am advised by Prof. Kezhong Liu in the Martime Intelligent Transportation System Group. I am also co-adviced by Prof. Cong Liu from The University of Texas at Dallas, where I have one-year visiting in the Real-Time Systems Group.

My PhD work has been focusing on wireless sensing techniques and machine learning algorithms for human localization, navigation and activity recognition in cruise ships.
My current areas of interest include wireless networks, mobile computing, big data analytics, real-time systems and related areas.
