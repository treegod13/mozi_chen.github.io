I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Traffic Information Engineering & Control from Wuhan University of Technology from 2016, where I am advised by Prof. Kezhong Liu in the Martime Intelligent Transportation System Group. I was Research Scholar in the Dept. of Computer Science, The University of Texas at Dallas, under Advisor Prof. [Cong Liu](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~cxl137330/) during Nov. 2017 - Dec. 2018.
My PhD work has been focusing on wireless sensing techniques and machine learning algorithms for human localization, navigation and activity recognition in cruise ships.
My current areas of interest include cyber-physical systems, wireless networks, mobile computing, big data analytics, real-time systems and related areas.
